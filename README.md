**Sunwatt – Tokenized Solar Projects Powered by SUNX**
------ 

**How to test the app**
1. Create a python environment (Conda, Venev) and install the `requirements.txt`
2. Run the Flask app: `python solar_crowdfunding.py`
3. Once running, run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

------

**Overview**

- Sunwatt is a decentralized platform for community investment in solar energy.
- Citizens and investors fund solar installations and receive SUNX tokens in return.
- Each SUNX token represents a fractional share in one or more Sunwatt solar projects and gives access to ongoing revenue from the sale of electricity to the national power grid.

**The SUNX Token**

| Attribute	| Description| 
|----|----|
| Token Name|	SUNX|
|Blockchain|	XRP Ledger (XRPL)|
|Token Type|	Issued Currency (XRPL native token)|
|Supply|	Defined per project (e.g., 30,000 SUNX for a €300,000 installation)|
|Initial Value|	Fixed at issuance (e.g., 1 SUNX = €10)|
|Ownership|	1 SUNX = 1 / total project share|
|Utility	Digital proof of ownership + share in revenue|


------
**Revenue & Distribution Model**

How it works:
1.	A Sunwatt solar installation produces electricity.
2.	All electricity is sold to the national power grid (e.g., EDF OA in France) at a guaranteed feed-in tariff (e.g., €0.10/kWh for 20 years).
3.	The revenue (paid in €) is:
  - Converted to XRP (or a stablecoin) via a crypto exchange.
  - Distributed proportionally to SUNX token holders based on their share.

Example:
€1,000 in revenue → converted → 1,300 XRP → distributed among holders.


------

**Ownership and Transparency**
- SUNX tokens act as on-chain certificates of ownership.
- Fully transferable (or optionally restricted).
- Blockchain guarantees:
  - Who owns what
  - How many tokens they hold
  - What share of the revenue they’re entitled to
  - Can be tracked through a public explorer or custom dashboard.

**Example Project Breakdown**

|Attribute|	Value|
|----|----|
|Project Cost|	€300,000|
|Power Capacity|	300 kWc|
|Estimated Annual Output|	360,000 kWh|
|Feed-in Tariff|	€0.10 / kWh|
|Annual Revenue|	€36,000|
|Tokens Issued|	30,000 SUNX|
|Earnings per Token|	~€1.20 / year|
|ROI |	~12% gross annually (if 1 SUNX = €10)|

------

**Infrastructure Stack**

| Function|	Tool / Platform|
|----|----|
|Token issuance|	XRPL Issued Currency|
|Ownership tracking|	XRPL Ledger|
|Revenue distribution|	Python/Node script or XRPL Hook|
|€ → XRP conversion	Exchange| (Kraken, Coinhouse, etc.)|
|User interface|	Web dashboard (wallet, yield, production)|
|Legal anchoring|	Off-chain contract (PDF or digital doc) linking token to real-world rights|

------

**SUNX Token Utility**
	•	Receive monthly or quarterly energy revenue (in XRP or stablecoin)
	•	Governance: vote on reinvestment, upgrades, or new projects
	•	Access to future Sunwatt initiatives (whitelisting, bonus yield)
	•	Trade SUNX tokens on XRPL’s decentralized exchange
	•	Digital green ownership badge (traceable & verifiable)

**Why SUNX Works**

Benefit	Explanation: 
- Passive income	Direct share in electricity sales
- Real asset backing	Linked to physical solar projects
- Transparent	Ownership & payments are fully traceable
- Simple & scalable	Easy onboarding, fast payments via XRPL
- Eco-friendly & inclusive	Supports the energy transition & citizen participation
