☀️ Sunwatt – Tokenized Solar Projects Powered by SUNX

⸻

🌍 Overview

Sunwatt is a decentralized platform for community investment in solar energy.
Citizens and investors fund solar installations and receive SUNX tokens in return.
Each SUNX token represents a fractional share in one or more Sunwatt solar projects and gives access to ongoing revenue from the sale of electricity to the national power grid.

🪙 The SUNX Token

Attribute	Description
Token Name	SUNX
Blockchain	XRP Ledger (XRPL)
Token Type	Issued Currency (XRPL native token)
Supply	Defined per project (e.g., 30,000 SUNX for a €300,000 installation)
Initial Value	Fixed at issuance (e.g., 1 SUNX = €10)
Ownership	1 SUNX = 1 / total project share
Utility	Digital proof of ownership + share in revenue

💸 Revenue & Distribution Model

🔁 How it works:
	1.	A Sunwatt solar installation produces electricity.
	2.	All electricity is sold to the national power grid (e.g., EDF OA in France) at a guaranteed feed-in tariff (e.g., €0.10/kWh for 20 years).
	3.	The revenue (paid in €) is:
	•	Converted to XRP (or a stablecoin) via a crypto exchange.
	•	Distributed proportionally to SUNX token holders based on their share.

Example:
€1,000 in revenue → converted → 1,300 XRP → distributed among holders.

⸻

🔐 Ownership and Transparency
	•	SUNX tokens act as on-chain certificates of ownership.
	•	Fully transferable (or optionally restricted).
	•	Blockchain guarantees:
	•	Who owns what
	•	How many tokens they hold
	•	What share of the revenue they’re entitled to
	•	Can be tracked through a public explorer or custom dashboard.

🎤 Pitch (1-minute version)

Sunwatt is a platform that allows citizens to invest in real solar infrastructure.
In return, they receive SUNX, a token that represents ownership in a solar project.
All electricity is sold to the national grid, and revenues are automatically distributed in XRP.
SUNX is both a green financial asset and a digital certificate of ownership, empowering people to earn passive income while accelerating the energy transition.
